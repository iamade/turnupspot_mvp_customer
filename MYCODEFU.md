when i click play whistle i want a real whistle sound, then the time at 7:00 should start counting down, i dont know which is better to perform the count down the frontend or backend but i prefer the backend for persistence. 

remove the start match button from the upcoming match card. while two teams are playing no other teams can play. also the teams in the upcoming match change depending on the score e.g if team 1 scores the upcoming match is team 1 vs team 3 and if team 2 scores its team 2 vs team 3 but if no one scores then the upcoming match is team 3 vs team 4.

the upcoming match becomes the live match when the 7:00 count ends at 0:00 then the complete match is updated with the details of the previous team and score.
