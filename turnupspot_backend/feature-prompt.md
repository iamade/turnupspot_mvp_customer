the way the football section of the app for this particular group playing 5 aside should work is when we have teams on the game day to play football . there are two stages of game play.
- the first is the general game play where every team plays against another team in the sequence of their group number.  e.g if we have team 1, 2, 3 ,4,5 then its team 1 vs team 2, the winner plays team 3, the winner plays team 4, the winner plays team 5 etc and the winner is selected as follows: if a team scores 2 goals first, so the score can be 2-0 or 2-1 but it can not be 2-2, the winner can also win if they score 1-0 and maintain the lead till the clock runs out. however when there is a draw e.g 0-0 1-1 but not 2-2 both teams leave the pitch for the next two teams to play. and there is a coin toss for the drawing teams to determine who plays first. the winner of the toss plays before the loser in the knockout stage and teams play priority is: never played > lost > drawn > won 

- then when all teams have played against each other in the general game play stage, the next stage called the knockout stage,the winner is selected as follows: the first team to score a goal wins the match, its called knockout stage for only that reason no team is truly eliminated.  however when there is a draw e.g 0-0 both team leave the pitch for the next two teams to play. and there is a coin toss for the drawing teams to determine who plays first.  the results from each play are used to determine the sequence of the knockout stage.  teams play priority is: never played > lost > drawn > won.

However, the system is not working like this, after a draw the coin toss is not being used to determine which team plays first in the knockout stage between the two teams that drew. the next two teams to play after a draw dont get selected. the frontend use of the coin toss is interrupted by the call to the backend for state. 

check the current implementation of the game play and knockout stage to see what is wrong and fix it.
